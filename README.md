# ‚òï Coffee Shop Challenge

## Project Overview

This is a Python-based Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) challenge that models a Coffee Shop system using three main classes:

- `Customer`
- `Coffee`
- `Order`

These classes reflect a real-world many-to-many relationship between `Customer` and `Coffee` through `Order`. Each `Order` belongs to a single `Customer` and a single `Coffee`. The project also includes aggregate methods and data validation to simulate core behaviors in a coffee shop system.
